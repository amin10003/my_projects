        <h2 class="defaulttext">The Code to Growth</h2>
        <p class="defaulttext">Frontend taught you how to build the world. Cybersecurity will teach you how to protect it.

The transition isn't about starting over; it’s about leveling up. Every bug you’ve fixed and every line of JavaScript you’ve written is a secret weapon in your new journey.

Be Patient: You are a junior today so you can be a specialist tomorrow.

Be Curious: Don't just ask if it works, ask how it could break.

Be Persistent: The best security experts weren't born—they were built one "Access Denied" at a time.

Your background is your edge. Keep building. Keep securing.</p>
            <h2 class="hide-text">The Architect’s Defense</h2>
<p class="hide-text">Developers create the logic that runs the digital age. Security professionals find the flaws that others miss.

You aren't just learning new tools; you are shifting your perspective. The JavaScript you know is now the key to understanding how an attacker manipulates the DOM to steal data.

Think Like a Hacker: Study the code you’ve written to find the backdoors you never knew existed.

Master the Basics: Great security is built on deep knowledge of Linux, Protocols, and Logic.

Stay Driven: Every failed exploit is a lesson that brings you closer to your first real "Bounty."

Your code is your foundation. Your curiosity is your weapon.</p>
